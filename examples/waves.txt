🌊🐳🌊 of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 we ourselves see in all
🌊🐳🌊 and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all. Now, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 begin to be over conscious
🌊🐳🌊 my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick-- grow
quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the glory and distinction of such offices
to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going
as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled
fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids. No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right 🌊🐳🌊
the mast, plumb down into the fore-castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time. What of it, if some 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 particular instance? Who ain't a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content. Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 But being paid,-- what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 consign ourselves to perdition! Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked, and every 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a
series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags, 🌊🐳🌊
endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.-- It's the Black Sea 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.--It's a blasted heath.-- It's a Hyperborean winter scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture's midst. That once found out, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself? In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads. The 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft's cockpits, especially of such 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of spending a sufferable night unless in some other

what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head." "Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?" getting into a towering rage. "Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?" "That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't sell it here, the market's overstocked." "With what?" shouted I. "With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?" 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 it is, landlord," said I quite calmly, "you'd better stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green." "May be not," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, "but I rayther guess you'll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin' his 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 savage goes up to the empty fire-place,
and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 chapel for his Congo idol. I now screwed my
eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and
applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off 🌊🐳🌊
heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock. All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 break the spell in which I had so long been bound. But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 "Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here wouldn't harm a hair of your head." "Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?" "I thought 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 into water and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 boot, and striding up to
🌊🐳🌊 bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 fine steel the head of a

quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
good thing; the more's the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 spent in that way. And the man that has anything
bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for. The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were nearly all 🌊🐳🌊
chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns. You could pretty plainly tell how long 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
had been ashore. This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 contrasting climates, zone by zone. "Grub, ho!" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to breakfast. They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Mungo's performances-- this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere. These reflections 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the table, and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 had boarded great whales on the high seas--entire strangers to them-- and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen! But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them-- at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that in most people's estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly. We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he eschewed coffee and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father
Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy
winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom-- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow. No one having 🌊🐳🌊
heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit. Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously contract the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany color, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel. The perpendicular parts of this 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec. I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 fifties being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited. With much 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 yet had a something in it which was by no means 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 devils. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 all this, there was 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man who 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and brighter relief, and looked
🌊🐳🌊 expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 had the same long regularly
🌊🐳🌊 retreating slope from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 casement, he never heeded my presence,
never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 over me upon waking in the morning,
I thought this indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first they are 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but
very little, with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty
thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is-- which was the only way he could get there--thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with 🌊🐳🌊
own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have "broken his digester." As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild stage when, after its first 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the air, it then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I'll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night's hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows. I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging puffs from that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan's breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply. After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room together. He made me 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his idol, and removed the paper firebrand. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 they spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it's a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and tried to talk their
🌊🐳🌊 Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home. By hints I asked him whether he did not 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 at the last accounts. He
🌊🐳🌊 no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 baptized again. For the nonce, however,
he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 future movements. He answered, to go to
sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 He at once resolved to accompany me to that
island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection
I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant seamen. His story being ended 🌊🐳🌊
his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping. CHAPTER 13 Wheelbarrow Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using, however, my comrade's money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg-- especially as Peter Coffin's cock and bull stories about him had previously 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 me concerning the very person whom I now companied with. We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to "the Moss," the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the people stared; not at Queequeg so much-- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,-- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmer's meadows armed with their own 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 private reasons, preferred his own harpoon. Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 carry his heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 said I, "Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think. Didn't the people laugh?" Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was; these 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse-- our first point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking. Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed. There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in

that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard. "But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 duties of the ship's company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the 275th part of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 long 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 it was better than 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a little distrustful about receiving a
generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the whole management of the ship's affairs
to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and reading his Bible as if at his own
fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 to himself out of his book, "Lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth-" "Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "what d'ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?" "Thou knowest best," was the sepulchral reply, "the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust do corrupt, but lay-'" Lay, indeed, 🌊🐳🌊
I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not lay up many lays here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a teenth of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time. "Why, blast your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, Thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that." "Seven hundred and seventy-seventh," again said 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 eyes; and then went on mumbling--"for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." "I am going to put him down for the three hundredth," said Peleg, "do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say." Bildad laid down his book, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 "Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and orphans, many of them-- and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg." "Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. "Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 sailed round Cape Horn." "Captain Peleg," said Bildad steadily, "thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg." "Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 me, and start my soulbolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-colored son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!" As he 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him. Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

the locksmith, there's one about a mile from here. But avast!" putting her hand in her side pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess; let's see." And with that, she turned it in the lock; but alas! Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within. "Have to burst it open," 🌊🐳🌊
I, and was running down the entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark. With a prodigious 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
door flew open, and the knob slamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He looked 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life. "Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's the matter with you?" "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?" said the landlady. But all we 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his regular meals. "Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's alive at all events; so leave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair myself." Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair; but 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 my polite arts and blandishments-- he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in any the slightest way. I wonder, thought I, if this can 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 way in his native island. It must be so; yes, it's a part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can't last for ever, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 I don't believe it's very punctual then. I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 shake yourself; get up and have some supper. You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg." But not a word did he reply. Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 on the man who was

this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to think nothing. At last it was given out that some time next day 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Going Aboard It was nearly six o'clock,
but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew nigh the wharf. "There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right," said I to Queequeg, "it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a voice, whose owner at the same time coming
close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 said I. "Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"
"Aint going aboard, then?" "Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours? Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?" "No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most 🌊🐳🌊
glances. "Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be detained." "Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?" "He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on." "Holloa!" cried stationary Elijah, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
when we had removed a few paces. "Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on." But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?" Struck by this plain 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 answered, saying, "Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure." "Very dim, very dim," said Elijah. "Morning to ye." Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and touching my shoulder 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 you can find 'em now, will ye? "Find who?" "Morning to ye! morning to ye!" he rejoined, again moving off. "Oh! I was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind-- it's all one, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it? 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 again very soon, I guess; unless it's before the Grand Jury." And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence. At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him. "Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?" said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 what I now alluded to; hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down; and again marking the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the body; telling him to establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there. "Gracious! Queequeg, don't sit 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

CHAPTER 23 The Lee Shore Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded mariner, encountered in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe! Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore? But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God--so better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 rule, he can't amount to

He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 must have been born in some time of general

than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a 🌊🐳🌊
Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. "I will have 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of a whale." By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 mate, "Starbuck, there, is as careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery." But we shall ere long see what that word "careful" precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or almost 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 him courage was not a sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling, courage was one of the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his own father's? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 courage of this Starbuck, which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time I ever did pray. It's 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 he's about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed
with. How he flashed at me!--his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad! Anyway there's something's on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don't sleep
then. Didn't that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a 🌊🐳🌊
brick had been on it? A hot old man! I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say-- worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He's 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should like to know? Who's made appointments with him in the hold? Ain't that queer, now? But there's no telling, it's the old game-- Here 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 snooze. Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 think of 'em. But that's against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes again. But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey, and piled a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that! He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me, and I didn't observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil's the matter with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?-- but the only way's to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me. "Will he (the leviathan) 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and sailed through oceans; I have had
to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle. First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that in some quarters it still remains a moot
point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, "I hereby separate the whales from the fish." But of my own knowledge, I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict, were still found
dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan. The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows: "On account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem," and 🌊🐳🌊
"ex lege naturae jure meritoque." I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug. Be 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 But in brief they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded. Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come. To be short, then, a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position. By the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host. *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 grin on his face. This whale averages some sixteen
or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the
supply of cheap oil for domestic employment-- as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil. BOOK II. 🌊🐳🌊
CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.-- Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 period after hung in the castle at Windsor." An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 must doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear
the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over
the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with 🌊🐳🌊
long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below, whether 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned. It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

peculiar mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints of his one 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 even as his nervous step that morning left a
deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him,
indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement. "D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick that's in him pecks the shell. 'Twill soon be out." The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the deck, with the same intense 🌊🐳🌊

an order seldom or never given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case. "Send everybody aft," repeated Ahab. "Mast-heads, there! come down!" When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the weather horizon 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:-- "What do ye do when ye see a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices. "Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them. "And what do ye next, men?" "Lower away, and after 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 dead whale or a stove boat!" More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other, as if 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 questions. But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:-- "All ye mast-headers have before 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: "Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, 🌊🐳🌊
ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil;-- Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great, unflattering laureate, Nature.* *I remember 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From
my forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. 🌊🐳🌊
flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman's name for albatross. So that by 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 noble merit of the poem and the poet. I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl. But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 silver-beaters could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of 🌊🐳🌊
hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge--pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt? 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 again. The latter was the

whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature he creates. CHAPTER 45 The Affidavit So far as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and, indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very interesting
and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately 🌊🐳🌊
and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair. I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be content to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
desired impression by separate citations of items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these citations, I take it-- the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself. First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a harpoon, has effected 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 and, after an interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years intervened between the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 harpoons; and I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 there is no good ground to impeach. Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example, if such 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 our way thither," he says, "about
four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 think; but every one began to prepare
for death. And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 ground. ... The suddenness of the shock made the
guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by
stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull 🌊🐳🌊
beneath. I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships, but 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured there! the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 with only one more and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

was commotion. The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 steward!" cried Ahab. "Time! time!" Dough-Boy hurried
below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact minute to Ahab. The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before it. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 looked to see them again directly in advance of
our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills around, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his could not now be in action; for there was
no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The 🌊🐳🌊
at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy's ship. But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale. With 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air. CHAPTER 48 The First Lowering The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;--a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 to be elsewhere. While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, "All ready there, Fedallah?" "Ready," was the half-hissed reply. "Lower away 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 say." Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 leaped down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats below. Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, "Down, down 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 have been visible at that moment; nothing
but a troubled bit of greenish white water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other indications, the puffs of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 outriders. All four boats were now in keen pursuit of
that one spot of troubled water and air. But it bade far to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills. "Pull, pull, my good boys," said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper 🌊🐳🌊
his men; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty. How different the loud little King-Post. "Sing out and say something, my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their black backs, boys; only do 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 and I'll sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay me on--lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad! See! see that white water!" And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed colt from the prairie. "Look at that chap now," philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his unlighted short 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 at a short distance, followed after--"He's got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em. Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive.

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 The repeated specific allusions of Flask to "that whale," as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

so many months or weeks as the case may be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest. I looked 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a snug family vault. Now then, thought
I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the devil fetch the hindmost. CHAPTER 50 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 "if I had but one leg you would not
catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe. Oh! he's a wonderful old man!" "I don't think it so strange, after all, on 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That
would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left, you know." "I don't know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel." Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the paramount importance of his life to the success 🌊🐳🌊
the voyage, it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase. So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight. But with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not. Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat's crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken private measures of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 piece in the boat's bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 straightened it a little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

going to the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship. Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Albatross South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts,
a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 tyro in the far ocean fisheries-- a whaler at sea,
and long absent from home. As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick 🌊🐳🌊
of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below. "Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?" But as the strange captain, leaning over the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between us. While 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale's name to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed--"Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the world! Tell them 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 if I am not at home, tell them to address them to-" At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,--"Up helm! Keep her off round the world!" Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 in any other part. It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 some the general interest in the
White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 men. This latter circumstance, with its own
particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three
confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.
Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it 🌊🐳🌊
transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record. *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head, still 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin. For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time. "Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days' sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage, it was observed that she 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more days went 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired. "Though no small passage was before 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 this affair stood between the two men. "But there was more than this: the order about 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the slow-match silently burning 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 as the customary sweepers; who,
🌊🐳🌊 being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied, with an oath, in a most domineering 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 which he had snatched from a
cask near by. "Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted
to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding. "Steelkilt rose, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to obey.
Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last
no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer: "'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to yourself.' But the predestinated mate 🌊🐳🌊
still closer to him, where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale. "Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads. They were both 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

scenes to be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 might, just risen beneath the boat from
the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the. air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is partially 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of
time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the
spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but 🌊🐳🌊
that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one. In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the fore-ground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered fortress, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole. Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery. The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began. Consider 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 this green, gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 moment, stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made. CHAPTER 62 The Dart A word 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 headsman 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 as temporary steersman, and 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the distance of twenty or
🌊🐳🌊 feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 intrepid exclamations; and what it
🌊🐳🌊 to keep shouting at the top of one's compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half started-- what that is none 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and the same time. In this
straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--"Stand up, and give it to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his harpoon from the crotch, and with
what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated;
no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if
you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted! Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and 🌊🐳🌊
to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper station in the bows of the boat. Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 caused them. To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of toil. CHAPTER 63 The Crotch Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the chapters. The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 second irons. But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended with the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades,* kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks, by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part.

brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.

🌊🐳🌊 return to the Pequod. "I fear not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab from the bulwarks, to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible plague!" "Gabriel! 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Mayhew; "thou must either-" But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of the horrible tail!" 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 thee again, Gabriel, that-" But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's
🌊🐳🌊 jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 name was mentioned, and the
🌊🐳🌊 sea that seemed leagued with him. It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a whale-ship, her people 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against
attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads,
Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling,
and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up
in his boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the 🌊🐳🌊
out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
nor a hair of any oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank. It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any. Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, on which the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 being stark dead. The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek--"The vial! the vial!" Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 believed that he had specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship. Mayhew 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab answered--"Aye." Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!" Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have just bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of letters for various ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 more. Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Ahab. "Give it me, man. Aye, aye, aye it's but a dim scrawl;--what's this?" As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

day, if opportunity offered. Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the masthead. But suddenly in the distance, they 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit. Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads-- namely, the two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 you will at last see a

command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 to see him, any more than if he were stealing
upon you from behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man-- what, indeed, but his eyes? Moreover, while in most other animals that I 🌊🐳🌊
now think of, the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale's 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 examine any two things--however large or however small-- at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 so much more comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years. CHAPTER 76 The Battering-Ram Ere 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its front aspect, in
all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain
an infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history. You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the 🌊🐳🌊
you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he has--his spout hole-- is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head; nearly one third 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 length from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale's head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 head; but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so thick is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses' hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it. Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indian-men chance to crowd and crush towards 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 do not suspend between them, at the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess what is called a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Whale, as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 now quiet, swinging perch overhead; and looking further off
from the side, we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave. "Both! 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one
hand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk. Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after 🌊🐳🌊
slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by the head. He averred, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 he came forth in the good old way-- head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as could be expected. And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 too, of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing. I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 We thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself. We 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the run, as you may say. Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was. Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of a man's character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the Sperm Whale. His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 As 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 through the remaining vertebrae 🌊🐳🌊

larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 will yet have reason to know. CHAPTER
81 The Pequod Meets The Virgin The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen. At one time the greatest 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 least; but here and there at very wide intervals
of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific. For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects. While yet some distance 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
bows instead of the stern. "What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to something wavingly held by the German. "Impossible!--a lamp-feeder!" "Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he's coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see 🌊🐳🌊
big tin can there alongside of him?--that's his boiling water. Oh! he's all right, is the Yarman." "Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He's out of oil, and has come a-begging." However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare. As he mounted the deck, Ahab 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 without at all heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching his having to turn into his 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 profound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a clean one (that is, an empty one), well deserving 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Virgin. His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod's keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea. Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations over-growing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubble. "Who's got some paregoric?" 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 mad Christmas in him, boys. It's the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 her way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes' army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to
them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in a great part 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when
a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea. "Haul in! Haul in!" cried Starbuck again; "he's rising." The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into 🌊🐳🌊
boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship's length of the hunters. His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and indiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 as they significantly call it, was untouched. As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes, or rather 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For all his 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the size of a bushel, low down on the flank. "A nice spot," cried Flask; "just let me prick him there once." "Avast!" cried Starbuck, "there's no need of that!" But humane Starbuck was too late. At 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 by it into more than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale. Let 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and though the battle 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 the animal ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 than the great Leviathan himself.
🌊🐳🌊 fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 hands fell off from him, and
only the stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 St. George. And therefore, let not the
knights of that honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 we are much better entitled to St. George's decoration
than they. Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 up by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a
whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for 🌊🐳🌊
of our clan. But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa; certainly they are very similar. If I claim the demigod then, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
the prophet? Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old times, we find the head-waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves. That 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose perusal would seem to have 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman? Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a member-roll for you! What club but the whaleman's can head off like that? CHAPTER 83 Jonah 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that. One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this:--He had one 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, "A 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Jebb's anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless. Another reason 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a herring or a cod might live a century, and never once raise 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 above the surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 alone; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 is on the top 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 head. If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 not think I shall err;
🌊🐳🌊 I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 to say, he would then
🌊🐳🌊 without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 particle of air; for, remember, he
has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 for an hour or more, a thousand
fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it
is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a
period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches 🌊🐳🌊
few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
these rates are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious it is it, too, that this necessity for the whale's 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 is incessantly going on--one breath only serving for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 spout-hole; and being so clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be water or whether it be vapor--no absolute certainty 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea. Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 whale to say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living. Oh! happy that the world is such 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

off a frock, and the hole is stopped. Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the sense of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 by the daintiness of the elephant's trunk.
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all.
What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 On more accounts than one, a pity it is that
the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart. Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas, 🌊🐳🌊
find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air! then smiting the surface, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole. Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the flukes lies considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime breach-- somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 those two opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our wake. Corresponding 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the whales; only they 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 to her own chosen pursuit,-- mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 some such fancy as the above
seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 was now both chasing and being chased
to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy
tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place. But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when, after 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the
Sumatra side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the 🌊🐳🌊
at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three keels that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
them,-- though as yet a mile in their rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity. Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating tokens that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 thither, by their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still engaged in drugging 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 where abundance of room and some convenient
retreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek
to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken
away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went. But agonizing as was 🌊🐳🌊
wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own comrades. This terrific object seemed to recall the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern. "Oars! Oars!" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--"gripe your oars, and clutch your souls, now! My 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 up--stand up, and stay so! Spring men--pull, men; never mind their backs--scrape them!--scrape away!" The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 giving way rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

means so scrupulous. Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 harpooning the fish; they were at last,
through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up with the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were remonstrated with,
their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the time of the seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued
for the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat. Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein 🌊🐳🌊
gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
by saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore when 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her. Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other. These pleadings, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 duly heard, the very learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,-- That as for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the aforesaid articles were theirs. A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter, the two great principles laid 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; For notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 props to stand on. Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession is the whole of the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful 🌊🐳🌊
taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color. Upon her head 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
large gilt letters, he read "Bouton de Rose,"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship. Though Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription, yet the word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently explained the whole to him. "A 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 whale; and so talk over it. Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?" "Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the chief-mate. "Well, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the White Whale?" "What whale?" "The White Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him? "Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale--no." "Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute." Then rapidly pulling back towards the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 report, he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted--"No, Sir! No!" Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman. He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 "Oh, nothing! It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain't it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?" "What in the devil's name do 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 said of the Frenchman's two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 did this odious stigma originate?
🌊🐳🌊 opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 always done; but cutting up the
fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 other course. The consequence is, that upon
breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used by the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,
fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the 🌊🐳🌊
were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite different from a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 of a Sperm Whale's flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great? CHAPTER 93 The Castaway It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's crew; an event 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 are pursuing the whale. As a general thing, these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats' crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

sperm of kindness. Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 it anywhere in the intellect or the
fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side; the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 long rows of angels in paradise, each with his

the thicker portions of his flukes. It is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but still contains some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble. Plum-pudding is the 🌊🐳🌊
bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 stringy affair, most frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing. Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but sometimes 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities. But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 receptacle for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted

thy hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp--all others but liars!

🌊🐳🌊 beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon's, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe. "All is vanity." ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon's wisdom yet. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop; Mounttop--the captain);-- as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here" (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); "yes, caught me just here, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way. I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 we had, and they were
🌊🐳🌊 trumps--every soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine gam I had-- long, very long after 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 ship; and may my parson forget
me, and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 by Patagonia), and all hands-- visitors and
all--were called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However,
the masts did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 for my taste. The beef was fine--tough, but with body
in it. They said it was bullbeef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after 🌊🐳🌊
were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread-- but that couldn't be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic, in short, the bread contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band. But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous, hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 the can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research, when 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem 🌊🐳🌊
was then composing-- at least, what untattooed parts might remain--I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale. CHAPTER 103 Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton In the first place, I wish to lay before 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
particular, plain statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here. According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 sixty feet in length; according to my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants. Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination? Having 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 you his skull, spout-hole, jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two feet: so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there. CHAPTER 105 Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish? 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 us from the head-waters of the Eternities, it may
be fitly inquired, whether, in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires. But upon investigation we find, that not only 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary
system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones. Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in 🌊🐳🌊
last chapter, and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen's authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
feet long at the time of capture. But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated? Assuredly, we must conclude so, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length-- Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 Banks and Solander, Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825. But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated. But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even through Behring's straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod's carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-hand, practical
extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark 🌊🐳🌊
this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:-- repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious. The one grand stage where he 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 various parts so manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever ready vices, and straightway files it smaller. A lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth. Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all the while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 done with all this weary roving?
Where go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 those far Antilles. If ye find him,
then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he's left his tambourine behind;-- I found it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I'll beat 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 "that in violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked

🌊🐳🌊 whale-boat. Shame! shame!" During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock. But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that his coffin was proved 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box; and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;-- at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort. Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 day. So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight. With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and emptying into 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil--the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 chickens, Perth? they are always flying in thy wake; birds of good omen, 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 across his ribbed brow; "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and dents but one?" "Aye, blacksmith,

as if it were full of gold coins. "I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 pouch upon the anvil. "Look ye, blacksmith, these are
the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses." "Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work." "I 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 glue from the melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me
the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I'll blow the fire." When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiralling 🌊🐳🌊
with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. "A flaw!" rejecting the last one. "Work that over again, Perth." This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside. "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?" muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. "That Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan." At last the shank, in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 its final heat; and as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face. "Would'st thou brand me, Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain; "have I been but 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this harpoon for the White Whale?" "For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself, man. Here are my razors--the best of steel; here, and make the barbs 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them. "Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup, nor pray till--but here--to work!" Fashioned at last 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near. "No, no--no water for that; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high up. A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 patris, sed in nomine diaboli!" deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood. Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before. "He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, his homage-rendering and invoking brow, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 vassal of the sun!-- Oh that these too-favoring eyes

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the windward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's. The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole; and the lantern hanging from its top, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 far out upon the midnight waves, which gently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach. Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching in the bow, sat watching 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 with their tails. A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air. Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped round 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in a flooded world. "I have dreamed it again," said he. "Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine?" "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?" 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

"Blast 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 he cried--"The corpusants have mercy on us all!" To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His "Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin" has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage. While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb. "What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 mercy on us all; and I hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?--have they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck--but it's too dark to look. Hear me, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 we saw." At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: "See! see!" and once more the high tapering flames were beheld 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod's jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 was indispensable. In a severe gale like this, while the
ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the Pequod's; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with 🌊🐳🌊
they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion. Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb-- one engaged forward and the other aft--the shivered remnants of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing. The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again; and the course-- for the present, East-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze became fair! Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 men!" the crew singing for joy, that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it. In compliance with the standing order of his commander-- to report immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck's heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

heave the log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form's sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden
reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; the sun and wind had warped it; all 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized
Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots. "Forward, there! 🌊🐳🌊
the log!" Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. "Take the reel, one of ye, I'll heave." They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side, where the deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the creamy, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him. Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to speak. "Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have spoiled it." "'Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 spoiled thee? Thou seem'st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it." "I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially with a superior, who'll ne'er confess." "What's 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in Queen Nature's granite-founded College; but methinks he's too subservient. Where wert thou born?" "In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir." "Excellent! Thou'st hit the world by that." "I know not, sir, but I was born there." "In the Isle of Man, hey? 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man; which is sucked in--by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So." The log 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely. "Hold hard!" Snap! the overstrained 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

slay him the more securely there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;-- and now that all his successive 🌊🐳🌊
with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man's eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months' night sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 sprout forth a single spear or leaf. In this foreshadowing interval, too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 in the clamped mortar of Ahab's iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them. But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 would have seen that even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable Parsee's glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being's body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by night, even, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say-- We two watchmen never rest. Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,--the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,--his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 were added on, that he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at times; or whether he was 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop. Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart 🌊🐳🌊
measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there. Ahab turned. "Starbuck!" "Sir." "Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 entrance to any sympathy from the green country without--oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before-- and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare-- fit emblem of 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 part of him slowly rose

over the agitated pool that he left. With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three boats now stilly floated, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 the whale's place, towards the dim blue
spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 Tashtego. In long Indian file, as when herons take
wing, the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered
down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the 🌊🐳🌊
bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern. Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its bow, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 made to face the whale's head while yet under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat. Through and through; through 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 rib, it thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the uttermost stern. And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 to lash them across. At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a movement that 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 of the bite. But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 now lay at a little distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows; and at the same 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or wind-bound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 Inferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales. The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannonball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field. "By salt and hemp!" cried Stubb, "but 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from
the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back into 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 sank in a shower of flakes, leaving
the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale. "Give way!" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 irons and lances from the two mates' boats, and dashing
in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar. While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again; at that moment 🌊🐳🌊
quick cry went up. Lashed round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab. The harpoon dropped from his hand. "Befooled, befooled!"--drawing in a long lean breath--"Aye, Parsee! I see thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 thing I harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.-- Where's the whale? gone down again?" But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore, and as if 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped. 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea. "Oh! Ahab," cried Starbuck, "not too late is it, even now, the third day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊

🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 judicious interval. Glancing upwards he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale's way now began to abate, 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊 🌊🐳🌊
